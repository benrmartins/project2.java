4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project was very difficult. But I was able to put into practice what I learned from
   class into this assignment. Using the lecture slides from class was very helpful in this project. Some parts of
   the slide had example code of the project, I just needed to format in a different way.
